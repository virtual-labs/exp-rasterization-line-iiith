Gain a comprehensive understanding of the procedural steps involved in a Line Rasterization Algorithm, specifically focusing on the conversion of a geometric line into pixels within a 2D frame buffer. The demonstration will highlight the step-by-step implementation of the Bresenham's Line Rasterization algorithm as a practical example.
