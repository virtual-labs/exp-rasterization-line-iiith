1. Shown on the canvas , is a 2-D pixel grid , similiar to how the computer renders graphics in form of pixels. For starting the simulation , enter the coordinates of endpoints for the line , to get started with the simulation. For providing a good visual experience , we have limited the range of coordinates of values for the endpoints of the line. To start the simulation follow the steps below : 

2. Enter the coordinates of the endpoints of the line , keeping in mind that 
   1.  the x-coordinate of the first point must be less than or equal to the x-coordinate of the second point 
   2.  the coordinate values must lie in the respective range for both x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
3. Click on submit , and the line in "yellow" with endpoints highlighted in "red" appears on the canvas , with pixel grids shown in the background.
4. Click on next to proceed with the simulation.
5.  On clicking next , the possible pixels ( the candidate pixels ) that could be chosen for representing the line on computer screen , which are highlighted in "blue".
6. On clicking next , the chosen pixel is highlighted in green , while the other is highlighted in red color. 
7. For moving back in the simulation , click on previous , to move backwards in the simulation. 
8. Click on Reset to clear the canvas .
