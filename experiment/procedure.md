1. **Introduction to Experiment:**
   - The canvas displays a 2-D pixel grid, representing how computers render graphics in the form of pixels.
   - To begin the simulation, enter the coordinates of the line's endpoints. Note the limited range for coordinate values to ensure a visually effective experience.

2. **Entering Endpoint Coordinates:**
   - Ensure that:
      1. The x-coordinate of the first point is less than or equal to the x-coordinate of the second point.
      2. Coordinate values fall within the specified ranges for both x-coordinates and y-coordinates.

3. **Initiating Simulation:**
   - Click "Submit" to generate the line in yellow, with endpoints highlighted in red, overlaid on the canvas featuring pixel grids.

4. **Proceeding to Next Step:**
   - Click "Next" to advance the simulation.

5. **Highlighting Candidate Pixels:**
   - The simulation highlights candidate pixels in blue, representing possible choices for displaying the line on the computer screen.

6. **Choosing the Pixel:**
   - Click "Next" to select the pixel from the candidate pixels.

7. **Navigating Backward:**
   - Use the "Previous" button to move backward in the experiment simulation.

8. **Resetting the Canvas:**
   - Click "Reset" to clear the canvas and start the experiment afresh.

This procedure guides users through the steps of the experiment, providing a hands-on experience in understanding Bresenham's Line Rasterization Algorithm.
