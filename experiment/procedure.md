1. Fix the size of the frame buffer (the default parameters are already filled in the input boxes) and then click on Enter.  
   You can also proceed directly to the experiment using the default parameters of the size of frame buffer and the starting and ending coordinates, by clicking on Start Experiment with Default values.  
2. Fix the starting and ending coordinates. The default values are already filled in the input boxes. Once you have finalized the coordinates, you can click on Start Experiment to begin with the experiment.  
   You can also go Back to change the values of the frame buffer.  
3. Throughout the experiment, you can click on Next Iteration to go to the next step of the algorithm and Previous Iteration to go to the previous step.  
4. Once the experiment ends, you can again experiment with a new line.  




1. The experiment contains a frame buffer which represents the screen to which the graphics primitives (line in this case) are rendered to.   
2. The experiment allows the user to change the size of the frame buffer.  
3. The experiment allows the user to choose the starting and ending coordinates of his own choice.  
4. The user can move forward and backward through the steps of the experiment.  
5. At each step of the algorithm, the important computations that took place in that step are also given for better understanding of the algorithm.
