1. Fix the size of the frame buffer (the default parameters are already filled in the input boxes) and then click on Enter.

   You can also proceed directly to the experiment using the default parameters of the size of frame buffer and the starting and ending coordinates, by clicking on Start Experiment with Default values.

2. Fix the starting and ending coordinates. The default values are already filled in the input boxes. Once you have finalized the coordinates, you can click on Start Experiment to begin with the experiment.

   You can also go Back to change the values of the frame buffer.
3. Throughout the experiment, you can click on Next Iteration to go to the next step of the algorithm and Previous Iteration to go to the previous step.
  
4. Once the experiment ends, you can again experiment with a new line.
