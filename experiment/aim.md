This experiment demonstrates the implementation of Bresenham's Line Rasterization algorithm to convert continuous mathematical lines into discrete pixels. The specific objectives are:

1. To implement Bresenham's algorithm for lines with slope between 0 and 1
2. To visualize the step-by-step pixel selection process
3. To analyze how the algorithm determines the optimal pixel arrangement without using floating-point calculations

The experiment focuses on Bresenham's algorithm as it provides an efficient integer-only solution for line rasterization, making it ideal for understanding the fundamental principles of converting continuous lines to discrete pixels.
